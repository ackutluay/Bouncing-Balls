# Bouncing-Balls
In this Python exercise, Several Bouncing Balls are simulated by matplotlib.animation. 

Bouncing balls.py : Default Bouncing balls.
Bouncing balls Hexagonal Shape : Only the shape of balls were altered and all the balls were speeded up.
Bouncing balls including gravity: This time, as a real time case, gravity will be included on the simulation, where we can observe the gravity applies only to the y-axis motion of the balls.
Bouncing balls Hex shape 2: This time, there is a limit ; if the balls hit the wall, they will be destroyed.

#Note: This simulation exercise is studied from the github.com/astroDimitrios/Astronomy
